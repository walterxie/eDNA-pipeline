This user interface is created by [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) for the demonstrating purpose. 
All images have to be in a PNG format to be abel to display in the UI.
But the high resolution images in a PDF format can be generated using [R code](https://github.com/walterxie/eDNA-pipeline/tree/master/R).

We are also welcome to any expression of interest regarding the collaboration in eDNA data analysis.
